<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Shraddhesh. I'm a computer nerd. The only reason I took Pharmacy was so that I can get a macbook.</p>

<p>I've always dreamt of being a developer now that I know Wordpress. <br />
  I wanna go one step further and learn about frontend and Backend of websites. <br /> 
  So I could explore endless possibilities of websites</p>

<p>It took me just 3 Hrs to Learn Wordpress but 6Hrs for me to make it for this portfolio in HTML. <br />
  It seems like a lot this would have taken me just half an hour in wordpress. I guess I would still go on. <br />
  Thanks for being on this journey with me. Stay Connected <br />
